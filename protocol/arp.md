# Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
```
ðŸ“– ARP is a protocol used to find the corresponding LAN address (e.g., Ethernet MAC address) from a protocol address
(e.g., IP address), often by LAN broadcasts.
```
## Workflow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant PacketHolderNode
participant OtherLANNodes
Note over PacketHolderNode: check my ARP cache
opt Destination's LAN address is not found in my ARP cache
  loop
    Note over PacketHolderNode: check ARP trying times limit
    opt Not exceed ARP trying times limit
      Note over PacketHolderNode: check if there is an unacknowledged ARP request.
      opt No unacknowledged ARP request
        PacketHolderNode ->> OtherLANNodes: broadcast ARP request
        Note over OtherLANNodes: update their ARP cache if necessary
        alt I'm who you're looking for
          OtherLANNodes -->> PacketHolderNode: ARP response
        else
          Note over OtherLANNodes: discard
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

```
