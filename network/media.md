### Guided transmission media
Guided transmission media, aka Bounded transmission media, are media that we can hold in hand:
- Magnetic tape
- Twisted pair
- Coaxial cables
- Power lines
- Fiber optics
#### Fiber optics
Light sources: LED or semiconductor laser.

| Aspect                  | LED        | Semiconductor laser        |
|-------------------------|------------|----------------------------|
| Data rate               | Low        | High                       |
| Fiber type              | Multi-mode | Multi-mode and single-mode |
| Distance                | Short      | Long                       |
| Lifetime                | Long       | Short                      |
| Temperature sensitivity | Minor      | Substantial                |
| Cost                    | Low        | Expensive                  |

### Unguided transmission media
- Electromagnetic spectrum
